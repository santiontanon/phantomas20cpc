# Instructions

Rewind the tape to the beginning. Press CONTROL+ENTER. Start the tape, and press any key. The game will load automatically. If anything goes wrong, rewind the tape again, and gently blow the tape and the tape reader on your CPC. Load the game again using a different volume. This will be useless, but it will keep you entertained for a while. If none of this works, just throw the tape away and use an emulator.

Insert the disk in drive A. Type RUN”PH20EN and press ENTER. IMPORTANT: this disk is not compatible with original 3’’ disk drives. You must have a 3.5’’ disk drive adapted to your CPC. This disk will not work on PC computers. Insert the disk in the slot horizontally, do not try to put it in vertically.

You can use a compatible emulator to play the game on an inferior machine. NOTE: some errors have been detected in some emulators which prevent from completing the game. We recommend using the Retro Virtual Machine emulator (www.retrovirtualmachine.org).

CONTROLS: O, P, Q, ESC (pause). The game allows you to redefine keys and play with a compatible joystick.

# Story

Phantomas is an android coming from very far away, from the Andromeda Galaxy. It was specifically programmed to steal and loot. During its last mission in the Earth-Gamma planet, it was captured by the police after stealing the hidden treasure from a millionaire’s mansion.

Now, it has a new mission, this time in our planet. Phantomas must adventure into the castle of the evil Count Dracula, who is spreading chaos around the region, and slay him. The goal is to reconcile with society and regain its freedom.

# The Game

To complete the game you must take control of Phantomas and go through the different rooms in the castle using keys, avoiding uncountable enemies and traps, until finding the three necessary weapons to defeat the vampire count: the cross, the stake and the hammer.

During your quest, you will have to open the six magical shutters of the castle, thus allowing sunlight to enter the castle to weaken Dracula before the final battle.

Luckily, Phantomas has good information sources, and a series of clues that will be extremely useful to complete its mission. You will find the cross at the top of the castle, but to take the stake and the hammer, you will have to access the catacombs, which you will need to unlock with the scroll. Once there, remember to pickup a metallic gear, which you will have to use with the “pedal-powered generator”, a strange device that will let you jump until the most important key of all: the one that opens the chamber of Count Dracula.

Once you have the three weapons and Dracula’s chamber room (which is cross-shaped) you can head to the tallest tower of the castle to engage in the final battle with your enemy.

Good luck!
